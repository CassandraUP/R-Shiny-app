### Overview
This repository provides an R script for generating publication-ready heatmaps from RNA-seq data. The workflow is designed to be flexible and species-agnostic, making it well-suited for comparative studies across diverse organisms.

Key features include:
- **Customizable input** – accepts standard RNA-seq expression tables (e.g., TPM, FPKM, or raw counts after normalization).
- **Cross-species support** – works with data from multiple organisms, enabling side-by-side comparisons.
- **High-quality visualization** – produces clear, interpretable heatmaps suitable for figures in reports or publications.
- **Scalability** – can handle small datasets (targeted gene sets) or large-scale transcriptome-wide expression profiles.
- **Flexibility** – adjustable clustering, color schemes, and annotations to highlight biological patterns of interest.

This tool is intended for researchers who want a straightforward way to visualize RNA-seq expression data without requiring extensive coding. Whether you are exploring expression differences within a single species or comparing gene families across taxa, this script provides a streamlined solution for producing informative heatmaps.
